# Background

Since I need to draw some figures in my thesis, and I have tried `draw.io` and `visio`. This post records some problems I met and the pros and cons of these two tools in my opinion.

# draw.io

## advantage

* convenient. It has the online web version. Just open it and use.

## disadvantage

* until now, I have searched the internet, there is no way to export figures in svg format with math equations. There will be some display bugs.

However, I have used `draw.io` for two months, it's a very good tool. If it solves the problem of export error, I will turn back to its faction.

# visio

## advantage

* good compatibility(兼容性)
* it supports export math equations in svg format

## disadvantage

* so difficult to install
  * you should uninstall your 365 office first, and install the specific version of visio, and reinstall your 365 office

However, though it supports export math equations in svg format, visio is not friendly to input math equations. You should use word get the correct format of math equations first, and paste it to visio as `a word document` format.

where there is display error, please check  `文件-选项-高级-禁用增强元文件优化`
