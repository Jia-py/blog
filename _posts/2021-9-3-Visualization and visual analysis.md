# introduction

data literacy : ability to convert data to information

people can understand the image data parallelly

地理可变单元问题(高松老师之前提及过)，也是一个可视化问题

可视化图像的设计师可以决定图像所代表的观点，甚至是相反的观点。

Why Visualization is important?

* comprehend huge amounts of data
* new insight
* reveal problems quickly

Computer Vision 与 Computer Graphics difference? maybe the same as the difference between information and data?

# Perception & Color

what is perception? the process we interpret the world.

try not to use too much conjunctions

find a symbol with a line is easier than without a line.

opponent color: black-white red-green yellow-blue

**additive** color,RGB ;**subtractive** color, CMY

for example, C(品红) in CMY can absorb Green and Blue, and reflect Red.

stronger pre-attentive cues by text than by color

color scales:

* qualitative scalle: 不同类别的颜色
* sequential scale: 单一颜色，不同深浅
* diverging scale: two sequential scale

color blindness

* rule1: maintain sufficient value contrast
* rule2: reinforce color encoding with position, size, shape

# Temporal, Geospatial & Multivariate Data

temporal data: set of values that change over time

Dimension Reduction

Dimension Ordering

## Geospatial data

map projection: must have distortions

- Conformal: 等角的
- Equal area:等面积
- Equidistance:等距的
