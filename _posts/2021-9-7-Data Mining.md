search recommendation why? because the user is usually not familiar with the problem, it's really hard to search the proper problem in only a few words.

wind shear: will leads to sudden change of the wind direction to a helicopter. it's dangerous.

**big data analysis**

* web data: google trends
* sensor data: wind shear
* scientific and medical data: patients data (privacy)
* document data: emails tweets weibo
* social network data: facebook
* customer data: product recommendation

**Nov 2 midterm exam**

some conferences: ACM SIGKDD, IEEE ICDM, ACM CIKM

KDD: Knowledge Discovery and Data mining, the discovery of knowledge( much human involvement)

data mining: the discovery of patterns (mechanical, less human involvement)



the simple process of summing, counting ... are not data mining. because data mining should **carry certain degree of predictive ability or descriptive ability**

* prediction: predict future behavior from past behavior
* description: summarize the underlying relationships in data and to describe the characteristics of data. (like the same features of cluster)



**OLAP: On-Line Analytical Processing**

allows users to view data in a data cube, selection, aggregation and summarization operations.

**classification**

**regression**

**clustering**
