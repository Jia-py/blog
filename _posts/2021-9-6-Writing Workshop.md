**Machine Learning Models For Diamond Craton Prediction**

As Diamond and its inclusions can preserve information about changes in the geological environment and are ideal for investigating composition of materials and the physicochemical environment of the deep earth[1], the research on the diamond origin craton has been a hot topic. 

With the continuous development of analytical techniques and data collection, the topic of the diamond origin has been solved to some extent. Stachel et al. summarized the diamond data from nearly 90 prior papers for source exploration and constructed the biggest diamond database in the world at that time[2]. In addition, Claude Dalpé et al. analyzed diamond samples from 2 regions and proposed the chemical elements of diamond impurities is helpful in determining the source of diamond[3]. However, these methods requires a priori knowledge and a time-consuming process, making determining diamond craton a time-consuming and complex undertaking.

In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have been greatly developed due to the increase of hardware computing power. However, conventional approaches such as instrumental analysis and human statistics are still used in diamond research across the world. Emerging technologies such as machine learning have not been introduced for diamond-related research.

To address the aforementioned problems and challenges, this paper will introduce machine learning to the diamond source research problem, construct a diamond database by processing data from a larger number of articles, and evaluate the classification performance of multiple machine learning methods.

# Literature Review

what is the gap, your study will fill the gap.

the whole thesis structure is like a hourglass, the narrow part is your current study.

## difference between discussion & conclusion? 

discussion can be focused on your study field, but conclusion is more broaden, it describes the application of other fields.

## difference between introduction & literature review?

in introduction, steps are background; literature review; problem definition; and overview

in related works, steps are study field definition; the solution up-to-date and their weakness; your research and solution.
