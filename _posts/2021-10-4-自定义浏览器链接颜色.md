# background

these days, I find the link colors of my edge are all purple. It's hard for me to identify whether the link is visited or not. So, I searched the internet and found this way.

# Process

1. install the `stylish` expand
2. add a new stylish script
3. input following script

```css
A:visited{color:gray ! important}
A:hover{color:#fb6667 ! important}
```

4. if you just want this script works in specific website. you can set the url or prefix under the input window.
5. save and turn to website to see the effect. complete!
